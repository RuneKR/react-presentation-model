# Motivation
This is meant as an architectural component that follows the principles of the PresentationModel. This is very close to what is also known as the ViewModel. 

The idea with this component is that you can write framework independent business logic that can be easily tested.

# State management
It should work with all major state management libraries although rxjs is currently used for state sync between ViewController -> PresentationModel.

# Example
Comming

# Feedback
This is an experiment. Happy to get feedback and improve.
